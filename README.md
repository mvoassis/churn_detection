Marcos Oliveira (mvoassis@gmail.com)


## Description

This project is part of Alura Challenges, where a set of analysis and Machine Learning models are applied to "Novexus," a fictional Telecom operator.

The objective is to help their team to decrease customer dropout level. In the initial meeting with the people responsible for the company's sales area, the importance of reducing the Customer Evasion Rate, also known as Churn Rate, was explained. After a meeting with the company's staff, they delivered a database with client and churn information, which should be analyzed, treated, and used to generate a classification model to identify potential dropout clients.

> Project developed using: Python, Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab), Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Numpy.
